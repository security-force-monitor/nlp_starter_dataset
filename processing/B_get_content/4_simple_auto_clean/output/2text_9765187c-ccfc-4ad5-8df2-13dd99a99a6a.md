CALABAR – CHIEF of Army Staff, Lt- General Onyeabo Ihejirika, has pledged to transform the Nigerian Army to make it battle-ready to tackle security challenges in the country.

Gen. Ihejirika at the commissioning of the renovated 13 Brigade Garrison Office building in Calabar, Cross River State, said one of the ways this could be achieved was by creating a conducive environment for their operations.

Represented by the General Officer Commanding, GOC, 82 Division, Enugu, Major- General Oluwaseun Oshinowo, Ihejirika said the old structures that used as the garrison office built by the colonial masters should be refurbished as it was a heritage of the country’s history.
