NSCIA To Boko Haram: Stop Spilling Blood

— May 9, 2013 | Leave a comment

The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) yesterday told members of the Boko Haram to accept the amnesty that may be offered by the federal government and stop further spilling of blood and wanton destruction of property in the north.

This is just as the NSCIA condemned insinuations that all the violence going on in the north is perpetrated by Muslims, saying that people of other faiths now hide under the banner of the Boko Haram sect to commit crimes.
