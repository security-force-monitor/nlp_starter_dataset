As part of efforts to curtail the numerous security challenges facing the nation such as insurgency, cattle rustling, ethnic crises in the north and kidnappings, militancy, and pipeline vandalism among others in the south, the General Officer Commanding \(GOC\) of the Nigerian army, Division 3 Jos, Major General Peter Dauke, has organised a special operational planning cadre course for soldiers drawn from about 10 army formations under the division.

Speaking during the opening ceremony of the 2017 operational planning cadre held at the ‘Shadawanka’ army barracks, Bauchi Tuesday, Dauke represented by Brigadier General Mohammed Hauwa Magaji, who explained that the exercise was aimed at refreshing the memories of his officers as well as giving them an update as regards operational planning, said participants were selected from all army formations under him which included: 33 Artillery Brigade, Headquarters 3 Division Tactical, 23 Brigade Headquarters, 27 Task Force Brigade, 28 Task Force Brigade, 29 Task Force Brigade, 43 Division Engineer, 53 Division Signal, 301 Artillery Regiment and 3 Division Garrison.

According to him, “You are all aware of the current security challenges faced by the military not only in the North-east but also in other parts of the country. It is therefore a collective responsibility to be committed to effective and efficient training in the military to ensure the protection of lives and property. I therefore urge you all to take this operational planning cadre very seriously.”
