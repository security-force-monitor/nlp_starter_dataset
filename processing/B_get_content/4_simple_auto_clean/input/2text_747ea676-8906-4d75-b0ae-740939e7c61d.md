Tactical Air Command  
The Tactical Air Command \(TAC\) was established in 1978 as the teeth arm of the NAF under which all the fighting formations and units are grouped. An Air Officer Commanding of aircrew \(pilot\) specialty, heads the Command.   
  
The Tactical Air Command is tasked with the responsibility of providing tactical training, the operational elements and resources necessary to meet the operational objectives of the NAF.   
  
Thus, the responsibility for the implementation of the NAF concept of operations of “active defence, forward engagement,” rests squarely with the Command. To achieve this enormous task, the Command is organised into groups and detachments in 12 locations across the country with the Command Headquarters at Makurdi. TAC operates all dedicated combat aircraft and most of the airlift assets in the Service. Equipped with an array of aircraft and weapon systems, it is capable of conducting all tactical air operations including counter air, counter surface and combat support air operations. Since the Command was established in 1978, it has grown and expanded with time. It has also made some giant strides and modest achievements in several areas both within and outside Nigeria. The Command participated with pride in the remarkable demonstration of airpower by TAC elements as part of ECOMOG forces in Liberia and Sierra Leone between 1990 and 2000. During these operations, its C-130s provided effective strategic airlift for Nigerian and sister African nations’ troops to and from the operational theatre. TAC Super Puma helicopter also performed creditably in tactical transport and medical evacuation roles, while the heroic offensive air operations conducted by the Alfa-Jets, remain a prime reference point in the modern application of airpower in the sub-region. There have been 26 Air Officers that commanded this elite fighting arm since its establishment. The chronicle of command is as indicated below:
