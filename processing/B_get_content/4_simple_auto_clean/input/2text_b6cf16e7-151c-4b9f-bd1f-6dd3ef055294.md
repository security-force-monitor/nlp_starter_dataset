The venue for the celebration is the Headquarters complex of 26 Task Force Brigade, Gwoza in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State.

The celebration of the Christmas with the troops apart from boosting troops morale, affords an opportunity to meet and celebrate the season of Christmas \(love\) amongst them in order to foster espirit-de- corps.

Similarly, the Chief of Training and Operations \(Army\), Major General DD Ahmadu led another team to Headquarters 27 Task Force Brigade, Buni Yadi, Yobe State, where they celebrated the Christmas with the troops.
